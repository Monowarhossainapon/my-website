Traveling to the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), we were eager to see how the “perfect” designs from our textbooks are implemented in the challenging environment of open-field research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrived at ASIRT, BARI.\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation of Research Our first stop was the ASICT building. During a detailed seminar, we learned about the 622 crop varieties developed by BARI. It was fascinating to hear about the “BARI Mango-4” and the “Anthocyanin Potato,” realizing that statistics is the backbone of these innovations."

We observed a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) being used to test pest management strategies.\n\n\n\nStatistical Rigor in the Field We observed how researchers blocked the area based on soil fertility and sunlight. A key takeaway was learning why predatory mites are ideal for these experiments; since they cannot fly, they remain within their assigned treatment plots, ensuring no “leakage” across the experimental units. This physical constraint validates the independence required for a robust ANOVA.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting the BARI Begun-8 research fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBARI Begun-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrient management of turmeric varieties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBARI Begun-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRice variety trials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField discussion"

The researchers explained that it is not enough for a variety to perform well once; it must show consistent yield across different environments and years. We discussed how they use multi-environment trials (MET) to identify varieties with high adaptability for farmers across Bangladesh."

They explained that in large fields, SRS can inadvertently lead to “clustering” in specific patches that might be unusually healthy or diseased. Systematic sampling ensures an even spread across the entire plot, providing a more reliable estimate of the variety’s true characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\nField discussion"

I realized that while our textbooks provide the rigid templates (like the RCBD or Factorial designs), the real skill of an ISRTian lies in adaptation. Whether it is dealing with limited space, soil fertility gradients, or budget constraints, statistics is the tool that allows researchers to find truth amidst real-world chaos."

Mr. Alfazal highlighted remarkable feats, such as the cholera vaccine trials. Matlab’s research proved that injectable vaccines were ineffective while oral ones were, leading the WHO to update global recommendations.

This appointment represents a significant milestone in my journey with the society, and I am eager to contribute to the continued growth of the research culture at the University of Dhaka.\nMy involvement with DURS has always been driven by a passion for academic inquiry and a desire to support the student research community. Previously, I had the privilege of serving as the Research Coordinator. In that role, I was responsible for facilitating academic resources and helping students navigate the complexities of research methodology. That experience was fundamental in shaping my understanding of the needs of young researchers and the importance of a well-coordinated support system within the university.\nAs I transition into the role of Joint Secretary, my responsibilities will expand into the broader administrative and strategic planning of the society. I look forward to working closely with the Executive Committee to streamline our internal communications and coordinate high-impact workshops. Our primary goal for the 2024-25 session is to create an even more inclusive platform where students from all disciplines feel empowered to engage in data-driven and meaningful research.\n\nReflecting on this transition, I am immensely grateful to the advisory board and my peers for their trust in my capabilities. Moving from a specialized coordination role to an executive leadership position allows me to serve the society with a more comprehensive vision. I am committed to ensuring that DURS remains a pioneer in fostering innovation and academic excellence throughout this upcoming tenure."
