### Training on Statistical Tools for Research (SPSS, R, and STATA) 
*Online Trainer | BDRS | July 2025 – Dec 2025*

::: {layout="[15, 85]"}
![](images/Statistical.jpg)

This intensive 3-month advanced training program is designed to build proficiency across three primary statistical platforms: SPSS, R-Programming, and STATA. The curriculum guides students through the complete research lifecycle, including complex data management, multivariate analysis (Factor Analysis and Reliability), logistic regression, and time series analysis. A strong emphasis is placed on reproducible research through the use of R scripts, Stata do-files, and SPSS syntax, culminating in a final capstone project using real-world research datasets.<br>
- [Session 2025–26](courses/spss-stata-r-course-2025/index.qmd)  – Conducted from July 2025 to December 2025
