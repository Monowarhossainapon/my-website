## About Me

I am a graduate student at the **Institute of Statistical Research and Training (ISRT)**, University of Dhaka, pursuing an **M.S. in Applied Statistics & Data Science**. My academic work is driven by a focus on using advanced statistical methodologies to solve real-world problems, particularly within the realms of public health and sociodemographic analysis.



My research interests lie at the intersection of **biostatistics** and **computational data science**. I am dedicated to exploring how rigorous inferential models and machine learning techniques can be applied to large-scale datasets to uncover meaningful patterns. At ISRT, I have developed a strong foundation in experimental design, survey sampling, and multivariate analysis, which I aim to apply toward high-impact research in the scientific community.
