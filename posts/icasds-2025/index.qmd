I recently had the opportunity to attend the **International Conference on Applied Statistics and Data Science (ICASDS 2025)**, held at the Nabab Nawab Ali Chowdhury Senate Bhaban, University of Dhaka. 

The theme of the conference, *"Data-driven Solutions: Unlocking New Possibilities,"* perfectly aligns with my current academic focus in my M.S. program. Over the course of December 28-29, I engaged with global experts and fellow researchers through a variety of programs:

### Key Highlights:
* **Keynote & Plenary Sessions:** Gained insights into the future of global data science trends.
* **Student Poster Competition:** Observed innovative research from peers, which was highly motivating for my own work on geospatial health inequities.
* **Networking:** Connected with statisticians and data scientists during the invited paper sessions.

Attending this conference was a significant milestone in my graduate journey, providing fresh perspectives on how applied statistics can solve complex real-world problems.
