I am deeply honored to announce that, as of September 11, 2024, I have been appointed as the **Joint Secretary** of the **Dhaka University Research Society (DURS)** for the Executive Committee 2024-25. This appointment represents a significant milestone in my journey with the society, and I am eager to contribute to the continued growth of the research culture at the University of Dhaka.

My involvement with DURS has always been driven by a passion for academic inquiry and a desire to support the student research community. Previously, I had the privilege of serving as the **Research Coordinator**. In that role, I was responsible for facilitating academic resources and helping students navigate the complexities of research methodology. That experience was fundamental in shaping my understanding of the needs of young researchers and the importance of a well-coordinated support system within the university.


As I transition into the role of **Joint Secretary**, my responsibilities will expand into the broader administrative and strategic planning of the society. I look forward to working closely with the Executive Committee to streamline our internal communications and coordinate high-impact workshops. Our primary goal for the 2024-25 session is to create an even more inclusive platform where students from all disciplines feel empowered to engage in data-driven and meaningful research.

Reflecting on this transition, I am immensely grateful to the advisory board and my peers for their trust in my capabilities. Moving from a specialized coordination role to an executive leadership position allows me to serve the society with a more comprehensive vision. I am committed to ensuring that DURS remains a pioneer in fostering innovation and academic excellence throughout this upcoming tenure.
