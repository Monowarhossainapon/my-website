# Available graphs

- For qualitative data

  -  Bar chart
  -  Pie chart
- For quantitative data

  -  Histogram
  -  Boxplot
  -  Scatter diagram

# Graphical presentation of qualitative data

- Bar chart and pie chart are graphical presentation for summary of qualitative data.
- In bar chart comparisons are made based on original scale of
measurement, while in pie chart comparisons are made in terms of transformed measurement scale (in degree)
- Therefore, bar chart is more preferable than pie chart.

# Bar chart

- A bar graph is another tool to represent frequencies or percentages of categories of a nominal or ordinal variable.
- In a bar graph, categories are displayed through rectangles of equal
width where heights of the rectangles represent frequency/percentage of the respective categories.

---


# Types of bar chart

The bar charts can be classified as the following way

- Simple bar chart (involves with single variable)
- Multiple bar chart (involves with multiple variables)
- Component (or Stacked) bar chart (involves with multiple variables)

# Simple bar chart

```stata
use birthwt.dta, clear

graph bar (count), over(low) ///
ytitle("Frequency") ///
title("Frequency distribution of low") ///
note("Source: Baystate Medical Centre, Springfield, MA")


graph bar, over(low) /*gives a percentage bar graph */


```


How to save these graphs?

# Pie chart

- The pie diagram is intended to compare the distinct components which together constitute a whole.
- The whole is presented by a circle of arbitrary radius and segments of the circle represents the component parts.
- The whole corresponds to the 360$^\circ$ which is the total number of degree in a circle. This 360$^\circ$ is to be divided proportionately among the components for drawing a pie chart.
