## Directory management

- To check the present working directory:
```stata
    pwd
```
- To change the current working directory:
```stata
    cd "E:\"
```
- To make a new directory inside the current working directory:
```stata
    mkdir "E:\StataClass1"
```
- To make the newly created directory as working directory:
```stata
    cd "E:\StataClass1"
```

# Reading a Stata data file

- Reading a data file from a particular location:
```stata
    use "E:\bd_individual.dta", clear
```
- Reading a data file from a working directory:
```stata
    use bd_individual.dta, clear
```

# Reading a Stata data file from a website

```stata
  use http://www.stata-press.com/data/r14/systolic, clear

  webuse query

  webuse lifeexp

  webuse apple

  webuse set http://www.zzz.edu/users/~sue
```

# Importing data files

- We can read dataset in .csv or .txt format, by using the following commands:

```stata
  insheet using bd_individ.csv, clear
  insheet using bd_individ.txt, clear
```

- To read an excel file we will use the following command:

```stata
  import excel bd_individ.xls, ///
  sheet("Sheet1") firstrow clear
```

- Here, firstrow means we can use variable names contained in the first row of the excel file as the variable names of the Stata file.

# Exporting data files

- Often, we need to save the entered dataset as .csv or .txt format, so that it can be read in different software.
- To create such a .csv file, we have to export our data as follows:
```stata
  outsheet using "E:\bd_individ.csv",comma nolabel replace
```
- Here, comma is the delimiter, nolabel means we want the values of the labeled variables as outputs, not the labels themselves, replace replaces any previous file in the same name.
- To export the data into .txt format we can use:
```stata
   outsheet using "E:\bd_individ.txt", nolabel replace
```

# Exporting data files

- If we want it to save the data in excel format, then we can write the following syntaxes:

```stata
    export excel using bd_individ.xls, ///
    firstrow(variables) nolabel replace
```

- Here, firstrow(variables) indicates we want to save the variable names into the first row of the excel file.

# Entering data into Stata

- You can enter data into Stata using **Graphical User Interface** (GUI)  by clicking the Edit button or by typing edit in the command window.
- Also, we can use a do file to enter data by writing the following syntaxes:

```stata
input hhid sex str10 location
10030 1 urban
10031 0 rural
10032 1 rural
end
```
where hhid and sex are numeric variables and location is string variable.

- For any string variable we need to specify the maximum number of characters the string will have using str10, where 10 indicates that location can have maximum characters 10.

# Entering data using Data Editor

- Now enter the previous data.



---

# Data editor

- You are allowed to enter, view, or edit your data in “data editor”. It looks like a spreadsheet.
- Typically, variables are listed across the top, and cases are listed down the side.
- To just have a view of your data, you need to type the command
browse in command windows; in the browse mode you cannot change
your data.
- To enter or edit your data you need to type edit which will take you to the edit mode.

## Do file

- A do file contains a list of Stata commands.
- The do file can be created using Stata’s do file editor.
