# About Stata software

- Stata is a software package used for statistical analysis. The name
Stata is a syllabic abbreviation of the words statistics and data.
- Stata was developed by StataCorp in 1985.
- Stata has always emphasized a command-line interface, which facilitates replicable analyses. Starting with version 8.0, however, Stata has included a graphical user interface which uses menus and dialog boxes.
- The latest release is Stata version 18, released in April, 2023.
- Purchase link: https://www.stata.com/order/dev/

# Overview of Stata file extensions

- Stata data file: .dta, example: mydata.dta
- Stata syntax file: .do, example: mysyntax.do
- Stata output file: .smcl, example: myoutput.smcl, smcl stands for
- Stata Markup and Control Language

# Stata windows

There is an additional window for graph that appears when a graph is
produced in Stata.

 - Command window: where commands are entered. Press the Enter key on your keyboard to execute any command.
 - Results window: where results appear (i.e, are printed).
 - Variables window: lists the variables in the current dataset.
 - Review window: lists past (i.e, already executed) commands.
 - Graph window: where graphs are displayed (appears when graphs are
generated).

# GUI and CLI

- You can either use the menu-based **Graphical User Interface** (GUI) or the command-driven **Command Line Interface** (CLI) to interact with Stata. But there are some advantages of using CLI:

  - **Command syntax** has the advantage of reproducibility.
  - Many of the commands are short and easy to execute, and as proficiency grows, it is often faster to type commands rather than use the menu.

---

We will mostly cover command syntax in this course. We will be providing commands so that you will become familiar with them. The commands will be useful for constructing longer and more complicated programs.

- The command executes if it is entered properly
- Issues an error message (in red) if it cannot figure out what to do, or
if there is something which could inadvertently change the dataset.
- If Stata gives you an error, it will provide you with a return code,
r(#). You can find out more about the error by typing: lookup rc #.
- To get help regarding any command, e.g. the regression command,
type: help regression

## Directory management

- To check the present working directory:
```stata
    pwd
```
- To change the current working directory:
```stata
    cd "E:\"
```
- To make a new directory inside the current working directory:
```stata
    mkdir "E:\StataClass1"
```
- To make the newly created directory as working directory:
```stata
    cd "E:\StataClass1"
```

# Reading a Stata data file

- Reading a data file from a particular location:
```stata
    use "E:\bd_individual.dta", clear
```
- Reading a data file from a working directory:
```stata
    use bd_individual.dta, clear
```

# Reading a Stata data file from a website

```stata
  use http://www.stata-press.com/data/r14/systolic, clear

  webuse query

  webuse lifeexp

  webuse apple

  webuse set http://www.zzz.edu/users/~sue
```

---

# Importing data files

- We can read dataset in .csv or .txt format, by using the following commands:

```stata
  insheet using bd_individ.csv, clear
  insheet using bd_individ.txt, clear
```

- To read an excel file we will use the following command:

```stata
  import excel bd_individ.xls, ///
  sheet("Sheet1") firstrow clear
```

- Here, firstrow means we can use variable names contained in the first row of the excel file as the variable names of the Stata file.

# Exporting data files

- Often, we need to save the entered dataset as .csv or .txt format, so that it can be read in different software.
- To create such a .csv file, we have to export our data as follows:
```stata
  outsheet using "E:\bd_individ.csv",comma nolabel replace
```
- Here, comma is the delimiter, nolabel means we want the values of the labeled variables as outputs, not the labels themselves, replace replaces any previous file in the same name.
- To export the data into .txt format we can use:
```stata
   outsheet using "E:\bd_individ.txt", nolabel replace
```

# Exporting data files

- If we want it to save the data in excel format, then we can write the following syntaxes:

```stata
    export excel using bd_individ.xls, ///
    firstrow(variables) nolabel replace
```

- Here, firstrow(variables) indicates we want to save the variable names into the first row of the excel file.

# Entering data into Stata

- You can enter data into Stata using **Graphical User Interface** (GUI)  by clicking the Edit button or by typing edit in the command window.
- Also, we can use a do file to enter data by writing the following syntaxes:

```stata
input hhid sex str10 location
10030 1 urban
10031 0 rural
10032 1 rural
end
```
where hhid and sex are numeric variables and location is string variable.

- For any string variable we need to specify the maximum number of characters the string will have using str10, where 10 indicates that location can have maximum characters 10.

# Entering data using Data Editor

- Now enter the previous data.



---

# Data editor

- You are allowed to enter, view, or edit your data in “data editor”. It looks like a spreadsheet.
- Typically, variables are listed across the top, and cases are listed down the side.
- To just have a view of your data, you need to type the command
browse in command windows; in the browse mode you cannot change
your data.
- To enter or edit your data you need to type edit which will take you to the edit mode.

## Do file

- A do file contains a list of Stata commands.
- The do file can be created using Stata’s do file editor.
